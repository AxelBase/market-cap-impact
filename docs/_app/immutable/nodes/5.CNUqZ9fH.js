This formula is the foundation of the Market Cap Impact Tool and the key to interpreting any asset's valuation correctly. Price alone tells only part of the story. Circulating supply completes it.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Circulating supply is not the same as total supply or maximum supply. It refers only to the tokens that are actually available in the market right now — tokens held by users, traded on exchanges, or used in the ecosystem. Tokens locked in vesting schedules, held by the project team, or not yet released do not count toward circulating supply. This distinction matters because only circulating tokens contribute to the market cap number that everyone sees and discusses.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why the Formula Behaves the Way It Does</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">When price goes up and supply stays fixed, market cap rises in direct proportion. A fifty percent price increase means a fifty percent larger market cap. The reverse is also true. When circulating supply grows — for example through token unlocks or emissions — market cap can stay the same or even increase while price falls. The tool lets you input any price and supply to watch this relationship play out instantly. You can see exactly how sensitive valuation is to changes in either variable.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The beauty of this formula is its simplicity. No complicated models are needed. Yet it reveals powerful truths. A project with a very high circulating supply needs enormous buying pressure to push the price significantly higher. Conversely, a token with low circulating supply can see dramatic price swings from relatively small amounts of capital. The Market Cap Impact Tool visualizes these effects so users can experiment freely and build intuition about what is realistic for different assets.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Using the Tool to Explore the Formula</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Start by entering a realistic price and the current circulating supply. The base market cap appears immediately. Then try increasing the price by ten or twenty percent. Watch how market cap scales. Next, keep price fixed and increase supply by ten percent. Notice how price would need to adjust to hold market cap steady. These quick tests make the formula feel concrete instead of abstract. Over time, you develop a clearer sense of how supply dynamics limit or amplify price potential.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The core equation is not just math. It is the lens through which serious observers evaluate tokens and cryptocurrencies. Once you internalize price times circulating supply, every headline about price pumps or dumps starts to make more sense.</p></article> <a class="btn btn-secondary mt-4">← Back to Blog</a></div>`);function F(m){var e=T();k("1apmzc4",d=>{var r=z(),g=n(v(r),6);c(4),o(()=>a(g,"content",`${s??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),f(()=>{b.title="The Core Formula: Price × Circulating Supply | Market Cap Impact Insights"}),i(d,r)});var t=l(e),h=l(t);c(4),p(t);var y=n(t,4);p(e),o(()=>{a(h,"href",`${s??""}/blog`),a(y,"href",`${s??""}/blog`)}),i(m,e)}export{F as component,S as universal};
