Nature of the Tool</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">The Market Cap Impact Tool is a free, <strong>educational</strong>, <strong>client-side</strong> static web application. It performs mathematical simulations of price–supply–market-cap relationships based on numbers you provide. <strong>All computations occur in your browser</strong>. The Tool is <strong>not</strong> a financial advisor, investment platform, trading tool, or price predictor. <strong>It does not provide financial advice</strong>, recommendations, or guarantees of future performance.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">3. No Warranties</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">The Tool is provided “as is” and “as available” without any warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. <strong>We do not warrant that calculations will be error-free</strong>, that the Tool will meet your requirements, or that results reflect real-world outcomes. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile; <strong>past patterns do not predict future results</strong>.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">4. Limitation of Liability</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">To the fullest extent permitted by law, the creators of the Tool shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of — or inability to use — the Tool, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Educational Purpose Only</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">The Tool is intended solely for <strong>informational and educational purposes</strong>. The simulations, projections, scenarios, and sensitivity grid are mathematical illustrations only. They are <strong>not forecasts</strong>, trading signals, or advice to buy, sell, or hold any asset. Cryptocurrency involves substantial risk of loss. You are solely responsible for any decisions you make after viewing Tool results.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">6. User Conduct</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">You agree not to use the Tool for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Tool or interfere with any other user’s experience. You may not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract the underlying logic beyond what is necessary for normal use.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">7. Intellectual Property</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">The design, layout, text explanations, and client-side logic of the Tool are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

Changes to the Tool or Terms</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Tool at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms. The revised version will be posted here with a new effective date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">9. Governing Law</h2> <p class="svelte-1e0rsuc">These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Tool operator resides, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1e0rsuc">The Market Cap Impact Tool exists to help you <strong>learn and explore</strong> market cap mathematics — nothing more. Always perform your own research and consult qualified financial professionals before making any investment decision.</p></article></div>');function W(p){var e=C();T("1e0rsuc",m=>{var o=w(),h=f(y(o),6);t(4),r(()=>l(h,"content",`${c??""}/terms`)),g(()=>{v.title="Terms and Conditions | Market Cap Impact Tool"}),a(m,o)});var s=i(e),d=i(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),r(()=>l(d,"href",`${c??""}/`)),a(p,e)}export{W as component,j as universal};
